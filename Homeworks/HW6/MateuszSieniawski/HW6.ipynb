    "I worked on the Titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this dataset there is a column `Sex`, which was the protected variable. I've trained 4 models: XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN. Their fairness perfomance was evaluated using 5 different metrics. I calculated the value of the metrics for both females and males, as each of them was a protected group.\n",
